Final project for Codecademy - "Build a Website with HTML, CSS, and GitHub Pages" Skill Path

I am focusing on using Git Bash and VS Code to commit & push - not using Github Desktop.

First note: After git init on local copy, I received this error in Git Bash:

$ git push -u origin main
error: src refspec main does not match any
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/Jamesllllllllll/colmar-academy.git'

I found a solution on StackOverflow: to have at least one commit before $ git push -u origin main

This worked, but I want to find out if it's possible to only use the three commands provided by Github.
